Notes taken while I attend software engineering lessons at the University of
Trento. I will keep them updated as I progress in my academic journey.

Most of the initial courses will be in Italian while later on some could be in
English. For now I keep them in their original language to reduce the
possibility of introducing errors due to translation.
