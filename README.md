# ICE notes

Notes taken while I attend Information, Communications and Electronics (ICE)
engineering lessons at the University of Trento. I will keep them updated as I
progress in my academic journey.

Most of the initial courses will be in Italian while later on we will start to
attend English lessons. I will keep them in their original language to reduce
the possibility of introducing errors due to translation.
